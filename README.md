# DipoleMoments

This algorithm was created at KU Keuven for the purpose of evaluating the latest data on nuclear Dipole Moments. This repository contains two main files:
- Analysis.py
- dipole_moments

The latter is a unique tabulation (Cut-off date: 12/21) of all experimentally known values of magnetic dipole moments obtained through Laser Spectroscopy techniques. As to our knowledge, this is the most complete tabulation of each kind and all the data were directly extracted from the relevant publications. This is an advantage - or we hope - w.r.t. other tabulations, which make changes to the values and/or the errors without consistent justification.

The code was made for two main things:
- Compare all known values with the Schmidt predictions, based on the extreme Single-Particle model
- Create charts of nuclides which depict nuclei with derised characteristics. To that end, the official IAEA database was also incorporated

Any useful modification and/or suggestion to the code is more than welcome. Special thanks to Prof. Ruben de Groote for his own contribution to the project.
